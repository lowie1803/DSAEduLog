***Welcome abroad!***



Moving from a competitive programmer towards a professional developer/engineer, I faced many challenges.
One of them is developing my products (runnable programs, educational systems, contests, ...) systematically.

The target is to help reduce manual works, generate educational products faster and save mental energy for actual creative works.
